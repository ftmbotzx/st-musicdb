# Media Indexer Bot

## Overview

This is a fully functional Telegram bot designed to automatically index and backup media files shared in Telegram chats. The bot monitors incoming media messages (audio, video, documents, photos), extracts metadata and track information, stores the data in MongoDB, and forwards files to a backup channel for preservation. It's built using the Pyrogram library for Telegram API integration and MongoDB for data persistence.

**Current Status: âœ… ENHANCED WITH SKIP CONFIGURATION - v2.8 (2025-08-03)**
- Bot now asks for skip message configuration when message links or forwarded messages are received
- **NEW**: Interactive skip configuration prompt with multiple options:
  - Number input (e.g., `1000`) to skip first N messages
  - `0` or `no` to start from message 1 (no skip)
  - `auto` to automatically detect first media message
- **ENHANCED**: Smart first media detection functionality 
- **IMPROVED**: User-friendly prompts with clear examples and instructions
- Previous v2.7 features maintained:
  - Minimal caption format (Title, Artist, Track ID only)
  - Title and artist extraction from original caption lines
  - Enhanced MongoDB schema with title and artist fields
  - Progress bar with speed calculation in files/min
  - Unlimited message processing (no 1000 limit)
  - Proper rate limiting at 20 messages per minute
- Previous features maintained:
  - Link extraction working perfectly with both \u2063 and \u00ad characters
  - Advanced \u2063 character detection in "info" sections for embedded URL extraction
  - Complete database export with ALL 30+ metadata fields in Excel format
  - Real-time progress tracking with fancy status displays
  - Track IDs prominently displayed in backup channel captions

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Bot Framework
- **Pyrogram Client**: Uses Pyrogram as the main Telegram bot framework for handling API interactions
- **Handler-based Architecture**: Separates message handling logic into dedicated handler functions
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Loads sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens) from environment variables

### Message Processing Pipeline
- **Media Detection**: Automatically identifies and processes different media types (audio, video, documents, photos)
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts comprehensive file metadata including file IDs, sizes, dimensions, and durations
- **Track Information Parsing**: Analyzes message captions to extract music track information and URLs
- **Interactive Skip Configuration**: Prompts users for skip preferences when starting indexing from message links or forwards
- **Smart Start Detection**: Can automatically detect first media message to optimize indexing start point
- **Backup Strategy**: Forwards all processed media to a designated backup channel for redundancy

### Data Storage Design
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses MongoDB as the primary database for storing file metadata and indexing information
- **Enhanced Document Schema**: Stores comprehensive metadata including file information, chat context, sender details, and extracted track data with dedicated title and artist fields
- **Improved Indexing Strategy**: Creates database indexes on frequently queried fields (file_id, file_name, track_id, title, artist, etc.) for performance optimization
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate entries using unique indexes on file identifiers

### Error Handling and Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Implements comprehensive logging throughout the application for debugging and monitoring
- **Connection Management**: Handles database connection failures gracefully with proper error reporting
- **Environment Validation**: Validates required environment variables at startup to prevent runtime errors

## External Dependencies

### Telegram API Integration
- **Pyrogram**: Python library for Telegram Bot API and MTProto API interactions
- **Bot API Credentials**: Requires API_ID, API_HASH, and BOT_TOKEN from Telegram

### Database Services
- **MongoDB**: Primary database for storing file metadata and indexing information
- **PyMongo**: MongoDB driver for Python database operations

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **MONGODB_URI**: Connection string for MongoDB instance
- **BACKUP_CHANNEL_ID**: Telegram channel ID for file backup storage
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration management through .env files using python-dotenv

### Media Processing
- **File Metadata Extraction**: Built-in capability to extract metadata from various media formats
- **URL Pattern Recognition**: Regular expression-based parsing for extracting track information from captions
